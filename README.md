 System Analysis and Design 
DriverPass a online lelarning platform for student drivers; wants take advantage of a void the market by building a using a browser bases client server architecture to train  students for a driving test at the DMV. DriverPass helps people passed her driving test by offering online training, test practice, and driving instructions.

I helped the company achieve a model that would give then a centralized system that could serve many with an  online presence that allows for multiple user and privilege types. 

Looking back I wish I could've done more work on the banking module but I had no idea how the internals of that would work.

It was an initial interview which gave me an idea of what the users needs were.  The people at the meeting were the stakeholders and no students. The secretary needed ability to assist in booking in sales. The admin needed the ability to reset passwords and download databases. The main thing that DriverPass needed was the ability for the student to login in and do perform. All the actions of the school. This meant that the company needed a client server model. 

The first is to get the design document, which Is basically the users requirements. I utilized charts and ULM designs thought the design process,  this gave me an overview of the whole project and a god visual reference. I also used an iterative approach to tackling each part of the program separately.   This helped later with keeping things modular.
